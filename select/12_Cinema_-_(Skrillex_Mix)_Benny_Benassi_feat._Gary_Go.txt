I could watch you for a lifetime, you're my favorite movie
A thousand endings, you mean everything to me
I never know what's coming, forever fascinated
Hope you don't stop running, to me 'cause I'll always be waiting

You are a cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are a cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

A cinema, a cinema, a cinema
Cinema, cinema, cinema

Stars spell out your name, like in a science-fiction drama
Romance roll in, like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessing, forever my wonder
Hope you start undressing, all my dreams until the end of

You are a cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are a cinema, Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

A cinema, a cinema, a cinema
Cinema, cinema, cinema

Never know what movie you're playing
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know what movie you're playing
Never know, never know, never know

You are a cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are a cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

A cinema, a cinema, a cinema
Cinema, cinema, cinema
